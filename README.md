# Prepare
* Download the database (option)
  CASMEII: http://fu.psych.ac.cn/CASME/casme2-en.php  
  SAMM: http://www2.docm.mmu.ac.uk/STAFF/m.yap/dataset.php

* if you wann't to download the original database, the **Data** fold contain all the needed data for this repositories.  
  1.*Add_python_layers* contain a .py scrip that for image and point data load in Caffe.  
  2.*Apex_Cropped_images* contains all the Apex images of three Database (namely: CASMEII SAMM SMIC). *Apex_Cropped_images.txt* contains image root and label in *Apex_Cropped_images* fold.  
  3.*OpticalFlowFeatureData.txt* is the temporal features described in our paper.
